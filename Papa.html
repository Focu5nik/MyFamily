            <h1>Dad</h1>
            <p>My father is the kind of person that does not show his feelings a lot. But I could say that he can be though; however, when his with me it is not like that at all, he might not kiss and jug me every single day, but when he does, it is what I consider the most sincere actions that someone can ask for. When e hugs me, I feel warm and loved, his hard skin becomes a soft thing. To conclude, some people may think that this essay is a little bit too cheesy, and maybe it is, but I do not care because there was not someone else that I wanted to describe like this. I have the wonderful opportunity to have this awesome father.  </p>
